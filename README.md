# Predict-Heart-Disease
World Heart Day Scale-up prevention of heart attack and stroke cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) take the lives of 17.9 million people every year, 31% of all global deaths. The number is growing day by day as the population is growing rapidly. This effect the poor and developing country the most. But there is hope because in recent times technology is so advanced and this technology accelerated the public health sector by developing advanced functional biomedical solutions. Which will help to make the right decision within a short time. In this project, we are trying to predict the heart disease of a person based on some medical information. Such as age, sex, chest pain (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), serum cholesterol in mg/dl (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), etc. With the help of those information's our algorithms will create a prediction result if the person suffers from heart disease or not. Which will help the doctors to take quick decisions whatever needs to be done in time. Those machine learning models takes short time to predict the disease with high accuracy. And this is how the machine learning model plays a big role in the medical science field.
